The Olivest Farms Tracker is a Responsive Web Application that is used to easily track data from a 
home Hydroponic system.

The Olivest Farms Tracker helps home hydroponic gardeners get the most from their hydroponic system. 
It facilitates the planning of the user's home garden based on the harvest dates of the plants they want to 
grow to help ensure a steady harvest. Once the plants have been sown and are growing, the optimal nutrient 
ranges are calculated to provide the best yields from their plants.

It's current tech stack is NextJS with Tailwind CSS for the front-end, PostgreSQL with Prisma for persistence,
and deployed in a Docker container.

It is currently in closed beta with a very limited set of users.

FOSS Flight is the beginnings of an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB).  

I started FOSSFlight because I was interested in exploring modern Android development and was frustrated with mobile apps geared toward general aviation.
The quality and user experience of existing EFBs were severely lacking.  The ability to create, modify, and use checklists, the most essential tools pilots use when flying, was incredibly painful.  
I was also frustrated with the cost of everything the student pilot and the other non-commercial aviation enthusiasts needed, so I wanted to offer a free alternative.

When I combined all of the above, I had a nice bit of motivation. Hence, FOSSFlight was born.

I approached the project the same way I approach any other software project, with testing and continuous delivery as first-class citizens.  I wanted to be as meticulous with FOSSFlight as A&Ps are when maintaining aircraft.

The project is [open source](https://gitlab.com/Spargonaut/FOSSFlight-Checklists).  The [website](http://fossflight.org/) has more information and some useful links, or you can install it from the play store.

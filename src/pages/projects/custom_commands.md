Custom Commands is a command-line application that makes it easier for developers to reuse and share complex 
CLI commands that are frequently used.  It allows the user(s) to keep their most commonly used commands and 
aliases under version control.  They can then be shared across machines, environments, and/or team members to 
help facilitate a seamless and identical developer experience in each.
